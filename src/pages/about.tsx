            I am a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Worcester
            Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and working in the Autonomy, Control,
            and Estimation Laboratory (ACEL) under supervision of Professor
            Raghvendra V. Cowlagi. I have general interests in robotics,
            real-time and embedded systems. My current research focus is on the
            sensing and motion planning of self-driving cars.

            I received my Masterâ€™s degree in Robotics Engineering from WPI in
            May, 2013. And I spent about two years working on the DARPA Robotics
            Challenge with Professor Taskin Padir. Our Team WPI-CMU ranked 7th
            out of 23 competing teams in the DRC Finals.
