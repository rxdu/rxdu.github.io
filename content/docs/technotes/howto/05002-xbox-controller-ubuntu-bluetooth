title: Connect Xbox One Controller to Ubuntu via Bluetooth

If the required driver module doesn't load automatically, the xbox one controller won't connect to Ubuntu reliably. In this case, you can load the module manually

```bash
$ sudo modprobe xpad
```

Then the controller should pair and get connected after you turn it on (pressing the xbox logo button), hold the bluetooth pairing button (the one beside the USB type-C port) until the logo light flashes fast.
