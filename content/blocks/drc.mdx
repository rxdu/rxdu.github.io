        <h5>DARPA Robotics Challenge Trials & Finals</h5>
        The DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) was introduced after the Fukushima nuclear disaster happened in Japan, 2011. It's aimed at pushing the boundaries of technology and making life saving robotics systems available for future disasters. WPI's entry of the DRC started from the Virtual Robotics Challenge phase, in which we got the 2nd place and won an Atlas Robot built by Boston Dynamics. During the DRC Trials phase, we formed a collaborative team with CMU and successfully qualified as one of the finalists in December 2013. Our team WPI-CMU successfully finished the DRC Finals and ranked the 7th out of 23 competing teams from all over the world, in California, June 2015. Our development work invovled many aspects of robotics, such as scene segmentation and object detection, whole-body control of the humanoid robot,  path and step planning, trajectory planning and control for manipulation, behavior management and human-robot interaction.
