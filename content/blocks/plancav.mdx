        <h5>Motion Prediction and Planning for Connected and Automated Vehicles</h5>
        Many people anticipate 5G communication would help autonomous driving make a breakthrough and reach the next-level of autonomy. But how is V2X technology actually going to make a self-driving car safer and more efficient? What if majority of surrounding vehicles are still manually driven by human even though  more and more of them are expected to be enhanced with communication capabilities? In this project, we studied existing/emerging vehicular communication technologies and investigated commonly available information that can be exchanged among vehicles. We tried to use probabilistic reachable set to predict potential occupancy by surrounding vehicles and evaluate collision risk within planning horizon of the ego (autonomous) vehicle. The goal is to selectively "listen to" vehicles that are relevant to ego vehicle's motion in order to reduce onboard computation as well as mitigating communication channel congestion in busy regions.
