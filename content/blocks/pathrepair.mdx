        <h5>Path Repair and Trajecotry Optimization for Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</h5>
        Small electric quadrotors have become commertially available for a wide range of applications, such as photography, construction site inspection and agriculture. Though these UAVs are suitable for cluttered environments by its size and manuverability, their applications are largely restricted to relatively open areas. Can we make them fly autonomously in places like warehouses, factories or densely populated urban neighbourhoods?      
        In this project, we proposed a path repair algorithm for small UAVs equipped with FOV-limited onboard 3D sensor to efficiently navigate in large indoor environments where only a 2D map is available beforehand. The vehicle would try to take full advantage of information from the 2D map and actively look for "shortcuts" in the 3D space based on analysis with the map together with realtime sensor data.
