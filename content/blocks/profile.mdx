        <p>I am a Robotics Engineer with a focus on autonomous navigation of mobile robots. My areas of interest include sensing and motion planning for self-driving cars, general mobile robot planning, control and simulation, and real-time embedded systems.
        I was a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and worked in the Autonomy, Control, and Estimation Laboratory (ACEL) under supervision of Professor Raghvendra V. Cowlagi. I dropped out of the PhD program in 2018 since I was not able to return to school for a prolonged period due to visa issue after an international travel.
